    "#1. What is a parameter?\n",
    "'''In **feature engineering** for machine learning, a **parameter** refers to a value or setting used to define the behavior or properties of a feature transformation or extraction process. These parameters play a crucial role in determining how raw data is transformed into features that can be used by a machine learning model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Roles of Parameters in Feature Engineering:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Transformation Parameters**:\n",
    "   Parameters define how data is scaled, normalized, or otherwise transformed.\n",
    "   - **Example**: In scaling features using **StandardScaler** in Python's `scikit-learn`, the parameters are the mean and standard deviation of each feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Encoding Parameters**:\n",
    "   When categorical data is converted into numerical formats, parameters control the encoding process.\n",
    "   - **Example**: One-hot encoding parameters include the number of categories and how missing or unseen categories are handled.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Feature Selection Parameters**:\n",
    "   Parameters are used to decide which features to keep or discard during the selection process.\n",
    "   - **Example**: In recursive feature elimination (RFE), the parameter might be the number of features to select.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Interaction and Polynomial Features**:\n",
    "   Parameters determine the degree of polynomial features or the specific interactions between features to create.\n",
    "   - **Example**: In polynomial feature generation, the **degree** parameter specifies the maximum degree of the polynomial.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Binning and Discretization**:\n",
    "   Parameters control how continuous data is divided into discrete intervals or bins.\n",
    "   - **Example**: In binning, the parameter might be the number of bins or the bin edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Imputation Parameters**:\n",
    "   For handling missing data, parameters define the method of imputation and the values to use.\n",
    "   - **Example**: Replacing missing values with the mean, median, or a constant requires specifying that value.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Dimensionality Reduction Parameters**:\n",
    "   Parameters control how features are reduced in dimensionality, such as the number of principal components in PCA.\n",
    "   - **Example**: In PCA, the parameter `n_components` determines how many principal components to retain.\n",

    "### Why Parameters Matter in Feature Engineering:\n",
    "- **Flexibility**: Parameters let you customize transformations to suit your data and problem.\n",
    "- **Model Performance**: Proper tuning of parameters in feature engineering can lead to more meaningful features, improving model accuracy and generalization.\n",
